# Car-Seat-Alarm-uC-OS

As of September 2019, 838 children under the age of fifteen have died from Pediatric Vehicular Heatstroke (PHV) since 1998. 
In 2018, there were 53 deaths attributed to PHV which is the most ever recorded in a single year [1]. If children are our future, 
then we need to stop losing them to preventable deaths and that's why we are working on the µC/OS Car Seat Alarm or CSA.
The objective of the µC/OS Car Seat Alarm project is to build software that will notify drivers if they leave a child in the car 
seat after exiting the vehicle.
